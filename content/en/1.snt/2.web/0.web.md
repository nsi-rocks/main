## Web and browsers
### What is the Web?
::callout
The **web** is a term that encompasses all the websites you visit via a browser.
::

- To access a website, you need to enter its address (also called [URL](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)), of the form `https://nsi.rocks`.
- It is not necessary to write the `https://` part because the browser adds it automatically.
- In the browser's address bar, you can write a URL to access a website directly, or write a search to trigger the search engine.

> **to do**  
> - in a browser's address bar, write `nsi.rocks` to access the site directly
> - in a browser's address bar, write `nsi rocks` (without the dot) to access a search based on the words "nsi rocks". You should find the site in the first results.

### Hyperlinks

A **hyperlink** (or hypertext link) allows access, from one document, to another document or to another part of the document. A hyperlink allows access to different types of resources, mainly media or websites/web pages. We will talk about this in more detail later.

In Markdown, you can easily create a hyperlink. For example, the following link: [NSI Rocks](https://nsi.rocks) is created in Markdown with the code:

```md
[NSI Rocks](https://nsi.rocks)
```

### Browsers
::callout
A **web browser** is software that allows access to websites. There are many browsers, among the most used we find: 
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/fr/safari/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/fr_fr/chrome/)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new/)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/fr/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/edge?form=MA13FJ&ch=1)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/fr)
::

Browsers often have many common features, such as browsing history, bookmark management (also called favorites, bookmarks), the ability to open multiple tabs in the same window, the presence of a search engine integrated into the address bar, etc.

## Personal data
We noticed in class that during navigation, users are often asked if they want to **allow cookies**. We also distinguished sites that require creating a personal account, and those for which it is not necessary.

**Social networks** have thus been identified as websites (or applications) that allow users without accounts to view some posts, **without being able to interact with them**, and that require users to create an account when they want to enjoy all the features related to the platform. The most observed features are:
- creating a post (message, status, photo, video)
- interacting with a post (comment, reaction)
- connecting with other accounts (subscription, following)

We identified a link between personal accounts and the existence of private data such as postal address, email address, payment-related information, and others. Thanks to the [CNIL](https://cnil.fr) website, we learned about the existence of the concept of **personal data**.

::callout
The [CNIL](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_nationale_de_l%27informatique_et_des_libert%C3%A9s) stands for **National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties**. It is an independent French administrative authority.
<br />
It is responsible for ensuring that information technology serves the citizen and does not infringe on human identity, human rights, privacy, or individual or public freedoms.
::

We distinguish two categories of personal data:
- sensitive data (see [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/definition/donnee-sensible))
- personal data ([see CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/definition/donnee-personnelle))
