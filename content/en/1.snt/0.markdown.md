The elements you need to know how to use for now are:
- put text in **bold** using double asterisks: `**bold text**`
- put text in *italics* using single asterisks: `*italic text*`
- create titles and subtitles using the `#` sign: `# A title`; `## A subtitle`
- create hyperlinks: `[displayed text](https://url-of-the-resource)`
