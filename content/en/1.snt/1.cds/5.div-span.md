## Introduction

In website creation, HTML tags play a crucial role in structuring and styling content. Among them, the `<div>` and `<span>` tags stand out for their flexibility and versatility, especially when combined with CSS classes. This course will introduce you to the interest of these tags and their use to build modern and adapted sites.

::tip
Before detailing the interest of `<div>` and `<span>` tags, let's talk about CSS classes, their usefulness, and see an example that we will use below.
::

## CSS Classes and their usefulness

CSS classes are essential for styling `<div>` and `<span>` tags. A class is an HTML attribute that serves to identify one or more elements to apply custom styles to them.

### Example of CSS declaration:
```css
.header {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

.highlight {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Effect of classes:
- The `header` class applies a light gray background, padding, and centers the header text.
- The `highlight` class makes the text red and bold.

## `<div>` Tag

::tip
The `<div>` tag is a container-type tag that serves to group HTML elements. It is often used to structure sections of a web page.
::

### Main characteristics:
- **Block**: The `<div>` tag occupies all the available width of the page.
- **Organization**: It allows creating logical divisions in the content.
- **Usage**: It is often used as an application point for CSS styles.

### Example:
::code-preview
<div style="background-color: #f4f4f4;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: left; font-weight: bold; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
    <ProseH1 style="font-size: 2rem;">Welcome to my site</ProseH1>
    <ProseH2 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Site made by myself!</ProseH2>
</div>

#code
```html
<div class="header">
    <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
    <h2>Site made by myself!</h2>
</div>
```
::

Here, the `header` class applied to the `<div>` allows styling the page header.

## `<span>` Tag

::tip
The `<span>` tag is an inline tag that serves to style a specific portion of text or an HTML element without disrupting the content flow.
::

### Main characteristics:
- **Inline**: It does not interrupt the text flow.
- **Flexibility**: It is ideal for applying styles to specific words or phrases.

### Example:
::code-preview
<p>This site is <span style="
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;">extraordinary</span>!</p>

#code
```html
<p>This site is <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span>!</p>
```
::

In this example, the `highlight` class applied to the `<span>` allows highlighting the word "extraordinary".
