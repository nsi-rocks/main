title: CSS Units
description: There are many units in CSS, we will explain which ones to favor and why.
---

Modern browsers support a large number of units for sizing web page elements. In a web page, you may need to modify the size of:
- text
- images
- different elements (menus, headers, etc...)

Not all units are systematically necessary, we will see in this page those that are most useful initially:
- pixels (unit: `px`)
- the `em` unit and especially `rem`
- percentages (unit: `%`)

::tip
Generally, **absolute** units are rarely used because they do not allow elements to adapt to the user's screen size.

We can add that units such as `cm`, `mm`, `pt`, `pc` are almost never used, because they do not correspond to the reality of a web page and therefore a screen display.

| Unit    | Relative or Absolute | Description                                                                                     |

| em      | Relative             | Relative to the font size of the parent element.                                               |
| rem     | Relative             | Relative to the font size of the root element (generally <html>).                              |
| %       | Relative             | Relative to the size of the parent container (can apply to margins, widths, heights, etc.).    |
| vw      | Relative             | Represents 1% of the viewport width.                                                           |
| vh      | Relative             | Represents 1% of the viewport height.                                                          |
| vmin    | Relative             | Represents 1% of the smallest viewport dimension (width or height).                            |
| vmax    | Relative             | Represents 1% of the largest viewport dimension (width or height).                             |
| cm      | Absolute             | Centimeter, used mainly for physical media.                                                   |
| mm      | Absolute             | Millimeter, used mainly for physical media.                                                   |
| in      | Absolute             | Inch (1 inch = 2.54 cm), used mainly for physical media.                                      |
| pt      | Absolute             | Typographic point (1 point = 1/72 of an inch).                                               |
| pc      | Absolute             | Typographic pica (1 pica = 12 points).                                                       |
| ex      | Relative             | Relative to the height of the letter "x" of the font used.                                    |
| ch      | Relative             | Relative to the width of the character "0" of the font used.                                  |
| fr      | Relative             | Fraction of available space in a CSS grid (used with grid-template-columns/rows).             |

## Accessibility
In browsers, you can define the base font size. This size will then be defined in the **root** element of the web page, i.e., the `html` tag.

Thus, a visually impaired user who would need to display text in a large size can configure their browser.

::warning
This is why we avoid using the `px` unit, which is an absolute unit. Text whose style is modified to be displayed at `16px` will therefore be the same size on a default-configured browser and on a browser configured for a visually impaired person.
<br>
We will then prefer the `rem` unit.

## Three practical units
### Pixels (`px`)
Pixels represent a fixed unit corresponding to a point on the screen. It's one of the simplest units to understand. It's particularly useful for defining precise dimensions, such as text size, borders, or margins.

**Example:**
```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24px; /* Fixed text size */
  margin: 10px;    /* Fixed margins around the element */
}
```

::warning
However, pixels do not automatically adapt to screen size or user accessibility preferences.

### Percentages (`%`)
The percentage unit is relative to a parent container. It's ideal for creating proportional elements, especially in fluid or responsive layouts.

**Example:**
```css
div {
  width: 50%; /* The element's width will be half that of its parent container */
}
```

Percentages are also used for properties like height, margins, or padding.

### Relative units: `rem` (and `em`)
Relative units allow better adaptability, as they depend on the font size defined in the context:

::tip
difference between `em` and `rem`
- **`rem` (root em)**: relative to the font size defined on the root element (`html`).
- **`em`**: relative to the font size of the immediate parent element.
::

**Advantage of `rem` over `em`:**
`rem` is more predictable, as it only depends on the size defined at the root, while `em` can vary according to inheritance and nested elements.

**Example:**
```css
html {
  font-size: 16px; /* Base size */
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 2 times the base size (32px) */
}

p {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Equal to the base size (16px) */
}
```

With these units, it's easier to adapt elements to different screens and text sizes, while respecting accessibility principles.
