We will increasingly talk about what is called **accessibility** in these pages. It is an important principle that allows adapting your web page to the visitor's needs. Some specific needs and adaptations to consider:
- Visual impairment or blindness: provide alternative text for images, use sufficient contrasts, and ensure compatibility with screen readers.
- Color blindness: choose appropriate color palettes and avoid conveying information solely through color.
- Motor difficulties: ensure accessible navigation via keyboard or assistive devices.
- Cognitive disorders: simplify structure and content, and avoid distracting animations.
- Deafness: include subtitles or transcriptions for audio and video content.

In general, modern browsers integrate devices to help people who need them, but this implies that the page creator has done initial work.
