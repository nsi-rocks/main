## Understanding RGB Mode
Each pixel consists of three components: red, green, and blue. By modifying the intensity of each component, we obtain the color of our choice.

In the vast majority of cases, each component is between two values:
- min: 0
- max: 255

This corresponds to 256 values in total, which is $2^8$, the number of values that can be encoded with **one byte**.
