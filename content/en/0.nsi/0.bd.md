The [Auto BD](https://educajou.forge.apps.education.fr/autobd/) application is free and open-source. It allows simple and efficient creation of comic strips.

We will use it for this session, with the objective of creating one or more comics, choosing one or more subjects from:
- a moment of great satisfaction you experienced in NSI, when everything goes well, when you reach your objective
- a moment that put you in difficulty, that required more investment than you expected, specifying the outcome
- a moment of your choice that you experienced within the high school, that deserves to be told

## Getting familiar with the tool
The [Auto BD](https://educajou.forge.apps.education.fr/autobd/) application is intuitive and allows many combinations. You have at your disposal different characters, backgrounds, objects. You can also add your own images.

Of course, one doesn't improvise as a screenwriter or comic author. Here are some tips to make your production interesting.

## Story structure
1. Define your main idea
Before starting, think about the content you want to evoke. If your comic is related to NSI, think about how you could:
- make others want to choose the specialty
- help your colleagues by showing the outcome of your problem, or the way you thought to solve the problem

2. Establish a three-act structure
- **Beginning**: Present the context and characters.
- **Middle**: Introduce the problem or significant event.
- **End**: Propose a conclusion or plot twist.

3. Work on the rhythm
   Vary the sizes of panels to energize your story. Large panels are ideal for strong moments, while small ones are suitable for quick exchanges.

## Creating dialogues
- Make your characters speak naturally.
- Use a tone adapted to the situation: humorous, serious, surprising...
- Avoid long sentences: a comic is primarily visual!

## Layout and readability
- Make sure the text is readable and well placed.
- Place bubbles logically to guide the reader.
- Use facial expressions and character postures to reinforce emotion.

## Finalization and sharing
Once your comic is finished, reread it and adjust the details. Then, you can save it as an image to share it.
