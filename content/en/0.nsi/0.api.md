### Preparation
- Get a domain: go to `nsi.rocks/api/cours/[your domain]`
    - instead of [your domain], indicate the domain of your choice. This would give for example `nsi.rocks/api/cours/formulaire-toto`
    - your domain must remain simple: no accents, no spaces, no punctuation, no uppercase
    - examples: "pokemon-pref", "musique-2024", "ville-denain", etc...
- A public key and a private key are provided to you, in the form:
```
Public key: formulaire-toto
Secret key: wrf7
```
- **WARNING**: the secret key must be kept carefully, and must not be exposed! If you forget it, remember to contact me.

### Usage
- In the `method` and `action` fields of your form, indicate:
```html
<form method="post" action="https://nsi.rocks/api/cours/[public key]" />
```
- In your forms, add a **hidden field** that contains an API key:
```html
<input name="api" type="hidden" value="my-api-key" />
```

### Viewing data
::callout
Your secret key allows you to view data. This helps protect data by preventing anyone from viewing it freely.
::

- From a script or browser, your data is available at the address `https://nsi.rocks/api/cours/[public key]:[private key]`
