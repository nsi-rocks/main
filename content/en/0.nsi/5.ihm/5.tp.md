We will create a simple little game:
- an element appears on the game area
- you must click on the element as quickly as possible
- we measure the time between appearance and click
::

:jeu-clic

## HTML
The HTML content of the page will be basic:
- a title
- a game area
- an area to display timer times

## CSS
The CSS will also be basic:
- style definition for the game area `#zone`
- style definition for elements that will appear `.item`

## JS
In the JavaScript part, we need to achieve several objectives.

First, we need to create a function (which we could call `popItem()`) that adds an element to the game area.
This element must meet the following constraints:

::callout
- level 1
    - the CSS class `item` must be associated
    - we modify the `top` and `left` style properties to get random values and stay within the game area limits
- level 2
    - when we click on the element, it is destroyed
    - when we destroy the element, it generates another one after a certain time
- level 3
    - when the element is created, we record the current timestamp
    - when the element is destroyed, we record the current timestamp
    - we calculate the difference between the two
    - we add an element in `#chronoList` to display the reaction time
::

This **main** objective involves secondary objectives:
::callout
- how to manage triggering the `popItem` function?
    - we can add an [event listener](./evenements)
    - we need to find how to trigger an event after a certain delay with [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout)
- how to add/destroy an element? [dom](./dom)
- what is a timestamp, and how to get it? [Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now)
