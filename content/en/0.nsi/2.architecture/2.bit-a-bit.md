## Why manipulate bits?

Bitwise operations allow manipulating binary values directly, that is, bit by bit. They are widely used in low-level computing, but also in concrete situations like:

- Controlling options in an application (each bit representing a parameter)
- Data compression and encryption
- Processing images, sounds or signals
- Microcontrollers and embedded systems

These operations are fast, memory-efficient, and often used in systems where resources are limited.

## How does it work?

Each integer is represented by a sequence of bits (0 or 1). Bitwise operations compare or modify these bits individually.

Example:
```py
# Binary representation
x = 5   # 0b0101
y = 3   # 0b0011
```

## Main bitwise operations

| Operation         | Symbol | Effect                                          | Example                         |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Logical AND       | `&`    | 1 if both bits are 1                          | `0b0101 & 0b0011 = 0b0001`     |
| Logical OR        | `\|`   | 1 if at least one of the two bits is 1        | `0b0101 \| 0b0011 = 0b0111`     |
| Exclusive OR (XOR)| `^`    | 1 if only one of the two bits is 1            | `0b0101 ^ 0b0011 = 0b0110`     |
| Logical NOT       | `~`    | Inverts all bits (two's complement)           | `~0b00000000 = 0b11111111`     |
| Left shift        | `<<`   | Shifts bits to the left (multiplies)          | `0b00000001 << 1 = 0b00000010` |
| Right shift       | `>>`   | Shifts bits to the right (divides)            | `0b00000100 >> 1 = 0b00000010` |

## Binary representation

An integer can be displayed in binary with the `format(n, '08b')` function, which displays the number on 8 bits. Example:

```py
state = 0b00000110
print(format(state, '08b'))  # Displays 00000110
```

## Concrete example: options stored in a byte

Suppose a program stores several options in a single byte. Each bit represents an activated (`1`) or deactivated (`0`) option.

```text
Bit 0: Sound enabled
Bit 1: Bluetooth enabled
Bit 2: Wi-Fi enabled
Bit 3: Airplane mode enabled
Bit 4: Notifications enabled
```

### Check if an option is activated
```py
state = 0b00000110  # Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled
wifi = 0b00000100
if state & wifi:
    print("Wi-Fi enabled")
```

### Activate an option (ex: airplane mode)
```py
state |= 0b00001000  # Activates bit 3
```

### Deactivate an option (ex: Bluetooth)
```py
state &= ~0b00000010  # Sets bit 1 to 0
```

### Toggle an option (XOR)
```py
state ^= 0b00000100  # If Wi-Fi was enabled, it's disabled, and vice versa
```

## Summary

- Bitwise operations act directly on the binary representation of integers
- They allow manipulating data in a fine, efficient and fast way
- The most common operators are `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- We can use bits to store and manage multiple states in a single integer variable

These concepts are useful in algorithms, electronics, and in all systems where memory optimization and execution speed are important.
