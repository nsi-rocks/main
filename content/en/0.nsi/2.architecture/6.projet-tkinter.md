## Personal project with tkinter
Following the introduction to tkinter that we saw during a previous session, you will now have to create a **personal project** that will use the **tkinter** module to produce a graphical interface.

::card{ title="Project framework"}
We have completed a tutorial on decimal, binary and hexadecimal bases. [A course](/nsi/architecture/binaire) is dedicated to it.
Here is the framework for this personal project:
- use the tkinter module to produce a graphical interface
- propose a conversion from base 10 to base 2, and vice versa
- propose a conversion from base 2 to base 16, and vice versa
- propose a conversion from base 10 to base 16, and vice versa
