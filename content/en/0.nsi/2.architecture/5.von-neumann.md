title: Von Neumann
description: Von Neumann architecture is a conceptual model for computers, proposed by John von Neumann in 1945. It forms the basis of modern computers. This architecture relies on four key elements.
---

## Main components

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Executes instructions. It includes:
  - **Control Unit**: Coordinates instruction execution.
  - **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations.
- **Memory**: Stores instructions and data in the same memory space.
- **Input/Output Units (I/O)**: Allow communication with the user or other systems (keyboard, screen, etc.).
- **Communication Bus**: Links different components for data, instruction and command transfer.

## Main characteristics

1. **Shared storage**: Instructions (program) and data share the same memory.
2. **Sequential execution**: Instructions are executed one by one, except in special cases (modern multithreading or pipelines).
3. **Execution cycle**: The CPU operates according to a three-step cycle:
   - **Fetch**: Reading the instruction from memory.
   - **Decode**: Decoding the instruction.
   - **Execute**: Executing the instruction.

## Advantages

- **Design simplicity**: Instructions and data are managed in the same memory space.
- **Flexibility**: Allows execution of various programs.
- **Basis for programmable computers**.

---

## Limitations

- **Von Neumann bottleneck**: Transfer between memory and processor can be slow compared to processing speed.
- **Corruption risk**: An erroneous instruction can overwrite important data or instructions, as they share the same memory.

## Conclusion

Von Neumann architecture remains fundamental for understanding computer operation. Although modern models (like Harvard architecture) have been developed to address some of its limitations, it remains a central concept taught in computer science.
