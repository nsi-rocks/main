## Introduction

In Linux-based systems, permissions allow controlling who can access what. Each file or directory has permissions associated with three entities:
- **Owner**: the user who created or owns the item.
- **Group**: the group to which the file or directory is assigned.
- **Others**: all other users.

Permissions define the allowed actions for each entity:
- **Read (r)**: read the content of a file or display a directory.
- **Write (w)**: modify the content of a file or change files in a directory.
- **Execute (x)**: execute an executable file or enter a directory.

## Permission representation

:imago{src="permissions.png"}

Permissions are visible with the `ls -l` command, which displays one line per file or directory:
```bash
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 12345 date file
```

::tip
Meaning of `rwx`:
<br>
For **files**:
- **`r` (read)**: permission to **read** the file content.
- **`w` (write)**: permission to **modify** or **delete** the file.
- **`x` (execute)**: permission to **execute** the file, like a program or script.

For **directories**:
- **`r` (read)**: permission to **list the directory content**.
- **`w` (write)**: permission to **create**, **delete** or **rename** files or subdirectories inside.
- **`x` (execute)**: permission to **enter the directory** (use `cd`) and access files inside (if file permissions allow it).

### Field explanations

1. **Type and permissions**: The first character indicates the item type (`-` for a file, `d` for a directory, etc.), followed by permissions for owner, group and others.
   - Example: `-rwxr-xr--`
     - `rwx`: owner permissions (read, write, execute).
     - `r-x`: group permissions (read, execute).
     - `r--`: others permissions (read only).

2. **Number of links**: Number of references to this item.
3. **Owner**: Name of the owner user.
4. **Group**: Name of the assigned group.
5. **Size**: Item size in bytes.
6. **Date**: Last access or modification.
7. **Name**: File or directory name.

## Modifying permissions

### Using `chmod`
The `chmod` command allows modifying permissions of a file or directory.

#### Syntax
```bash
chmod [options] mode file
```

#### Modes
1. **Symbolic**:
   - `u`: owner (user).
   - `g`: group.
   - `o`: others.
   - `a`: all.
   - Actions: `+` (add), `-` (remove), `=` (set).

   Example:
   ```bash
   chmod u+x file # Adds execution for owner.
   chmod u+rw file # Adds read and write for owner.
   chmod g-w file # Removes write for group.
   chmod a=r file  # Gives only read to all.
   ```

2. **Octal**:
   - Each entity (u, g, o) is represented by a digit (0 to 7):
     - Read: 4.
     - Write: 2.
     - Execute: 1.

   Example:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 file # rwx for owner, r-x for others.
   chmod 644 file # rw- for owner, r-- for others.
   ```

### Using `chown`
The `chown` command allows changing the owner or group of a file or directory.

#### Syntax
```bash
chown [owner][:group] file
```

Examples:
```bash
chown alice file         # Changes owner to "alice".
chown alice:developers file # Changes owner and group.
chown :developers file # Changes group
```

### Using `chgrp`
The `chgrp` command modifies only the group.
```bash
chgrp developers file
```

## Special permissions

Some files or directories may have additional permissions:

### Setuid
- Allows an executable file to be executed with its owner's privileges.
- Represented by an `s` instead of `x` in owner permissions.
- Example:
  ```bash
  chmod u+s file
  ```

### Setgid
- Allows a file or directory to be executed with its group's privileges.
- Represented by an `s` instead of `x` in group permissions.
- Example:
  ```bash
  chmod g+s file
  ```

### Sticky Bit
- Applied to directories so that only the owner or root can delete their files.
- Represented by a `t` instead of `x` in others permissions.
- Example:
  ```bash
  chmod +t directory
  ```

## Conclusion

Permissions are essential for Linux system security and management. By understanding their operation and manipulation, you can precisely control access to your files and directories. This helps prevent errors and protect sensitive data.
