## A bit of history
Linux is an operating system that emerged in 1991, created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student. It is inspired by the UNIX system, developed in the 1970s, which was designed to be portable, multitasking and multi-user.

Linux was made available under a free license (the GPL license) allowing anyone to modify, share and use it for free. This encouraged the creation of a large community of developers and users.

## The philosophy of Linux
Linux is based on the principles of free software:

- **Freedom to use**: you can use Linux for any purpose.
- **Freedom to study and modify**: the source code is accessible to everyone.
- **Freedom to share**: you can distribute copies of the software, modified or not.

These ideas are part of a broader movement called "open source", which values collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## What is a Linux distribution?
Linux itself is a kernel, that is, the central part that manages hardware and resources. To create a complete system, we assemble this kernel with software. This gives what we call a "distribution".

### Examples of popular distributions:

- **Mint**: ideal for beginners, it is simple to use and has a large community.
- **Debian**: known for its stability, it's a base for many other distributions, like Ubuntu.
- **Fedora**: focuses on integrating the latest technologies.
- **Arch Linux**: for advanced users who want a customized system.
- **Kali Linux**: specialized for security testing and ethical hacking.

### Linux in daily life
You might already be using Linux without knowing it! It's present in Android smartphones, many web servers, and even connected objects like Internet boxes.

## Why learn Linux?

1. **Understanding computer basics**: Linux offers a concrete approach to learning how operating systems work.
2. **Autonomy**: command-line tools allow automating and solving complex problems.
3. **Career**: Linux is widely used in companies, particularly in servers, cloud, and cybersecurity.

## Conclusion
Linux is not just an operating system, it's also a way of thinking about computing, based on sharing, freedom and collaboration. As NSI students, you'll have the opportunity to discover an environment that encourages exploration and learning.
