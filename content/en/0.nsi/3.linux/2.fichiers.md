description: Introduction to the basic structure of the Linux file system, and introduction to the concepts of relative and absolute paths.

## File system organization
The file system under Linux follows a hierarchical structure in the form of an inverted tree. Everything starts at the root represented by `/`.

### Basic structure
Here are some important directories generally found at the root:

- `/bin`: Contains essential programs accessible by all users.
- `/etc`: Contains system configuration files.
- `/home`: Contains users' personal folders.
- `/var`: Contains variable files like system logs.
- `/tmp`: Directory for temporary files.
- `/usr`: Contains additional programs and files.

::tip
Each directory has a specific function and can contain subdirectories or files.
::

### Hierarchy example
Here's a simplified representation:
```
/
|-- bin
|-- etc
|-- home
|   |-- user1
|   |-- user2
|-- var
|-- tmp
|-- usr
```

## Paths in the file system
A path designates the location of a file or directory in the system.

### Absolute path
An absolute path always starts from the root (`/`) and specifies the exact location.

- Example:
  - `/home/user1/document.txt`
  - `/etc/hosts`

### Relative path
A relative path is defined relative to the current directory (where you are in the system).

- Example:
  - If the current directory is `/home/user1`:
    - `document.txt` refers to `/home/user1/document.txt`
    - `../user2` refers to `/home/user2`

### Important symbols
- `.`: Represents the current directory.
- `..`: Represents the parent directory.

#### Practical example
1. You are in `/home/user1`.
   - Typing `ls ..` lists the contents of `/home`.
   - Typing `cd ../user2` places you in `/home/user2`.

## Practice

### Identifying absolute paths
:::tabs
::tabs-item{label="Question"}
Among the following paths, which ones are absolute?
- `/etc/passwd`
- `document.txt`
- `/var/log/syslog`
- `../photos`
::

::tabs-item{label="Answer"}
`/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/syslog` are absolute paths.
::
:::

### Navigating the file system
:::tabs
::tabs-item{label="Question"}
1. From `/home/user1`, access `/home/user2` using a relative path.
2. From `/home`, access `/etc` using an absolute path.

::

::tabs-item{label="Answer"}
1. We'll refer to `../` to go up one level, to be in `/home`, which would give the following path: `../user2`.
2. The absolute path doesn't need to know which folder we're in, so it will be enough to refer to `/etc`.

## Summary
- The Linux file system is organized hierarchically with a root `/`.
- An absolute path always starts with `/`.
- A relative path depends on the current directory and uses `.` or `..` to navigate.
