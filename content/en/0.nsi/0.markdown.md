A description of the Markdown language is available here: [https://nsi.rocks/articles/markdown](https://nsi.rocks/articles/markdown)

The elements you need to know how to use for now are:
- make text **bold** with double asterisks: `**bold text**`
- make text *italic* with single asterisks: `*italic text*`
- create titles and subtitles with the `#` symbol: `# A title`; `## A subtitle`
- create hypertext links: `[displayed text](https://url-of-the-resource)`
