title: Protecting Constant Variables
description: When retrieving data, for example from a CSV file, it's essential to protect variables that must remain unchanged. We'll see some simple best practices to avoid involuntary errors.
---

## Why protect certain variables?
When reading data from a file (like a CSV), it's common to want to keep an intact copy of the original data, even after processing it.

If we accidentally modify a variable containing important data, we risk losing information and making the program difficult to fix.

::tip
Protecting a variable doesn't mean it's "really" constant in Python, but that we adopt conventions to avoid modifying it by mistake.
::

## Convention: write in uppercase
In Python, it's customary to write the names of variables we want to consider as constants **entirely in uppercase**.

Example:
```python
ORIGINAL_DATA = ["Name", "Firstname", "Age"]
```
This indicates to code readers (and ourselves!) that this variable should not be modified.

## Use a tuple instead of a list
A **tuple** is an immutable structure in Python: we cannot modify its content after creation.

Thus, to protect a set of fixed values, it's preferable to use a tuple:

```python
EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ("Name", "Firstname", "Age")
```

::note
Warning: if the tuple contains objects that are themselves modifiable (like lists), their content can be modified. The tuple only makes the "structure" immutable.
::

## Clearly name transformation steps
When processing data (cleaning, sorting, typing...), it's useful to create **new variables at each step**, with precise names.

For example:
```python
csv_data = load_csv("file.csv")
cleaned_data = clean(csv_data)
typed_data = type(cleaned_data)
```

This allows:
- keeping previous versions if needed,
- better understanding the sequence of transformations,
- limiting errors by directly modifying the right data.

::tip
Each variable should have a name that recalls the processing step it represents.
