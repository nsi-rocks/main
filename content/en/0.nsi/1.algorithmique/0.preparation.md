title: Preparing Your Program
---

## Describe in Natural Language
Before coding, it is crucial to properly prepare your program. Here are the recommended steps:
- Think about inputs and outputs.
- Break down the problem into sub-problems.
- Write the steps with simple sentences, like a recipe.
- Think about necessary conditions and loops.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
- Don't worry about code syntax.

**Example (ROT13 on a letter):**
```
1. Read a letter.
2. Find its position in the alphabet.
3. Add 13 to this position.
4. If we exceed Z, go back to the beginning of the alphabet.
5. Give the new letter.
```

## Translate to Pseudocode
- Pseudocode resembles code but remains independent of a specific language.
- Use simple keywords: IF, THEN, ELSE, FOR, WHILE…

**Example (ROT13 on a letter):**
```
Read letter
position ← rank(letter)
new_position ← position + 13
IF new_position > 26 THEN
new_position ← new_position - 26
END IF
Display corresponding_letter(new_position)
```

## Key Points to Remember
- Always start in natural language: clarifies reasoning.
- Then move to pseudocode: structures the logic.
- Finally translate to Python: this is only the last step.
