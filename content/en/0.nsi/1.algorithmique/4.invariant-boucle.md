title: Loop Invariant
description: When programming a loop, it's often useful to be able to reason about what doesn't change during its execution. This is called a loop invariant.
---

## Why talk about invariant?
When we use a loop (for or while), we often modify variables at each iteration. But **certain properties remain true throughout the loop**: these are the **invariants**.

::tip
A loop invariant is a logical condition that is true:
- before the first iteration of the loop,
- at the end of each iteration.
This helps understand and prove that the algorithm works correctly.
::

## Example: sum of a list
We want to calculate the sum of elements in a list.
```python
list = [2, 5, 7, 3]
sum = 0
for value in list:
    sum += value
```

During execution, at each loop turn:
- `sum` contains the sum **of already traversed elements** of the list.

So, **loop invariant**:
> sum contains the sum of elements in `list` already seen.

## Another example: finding the largest element
```python
list = [6, 4, 9, 1]
maximum = list[0]
for element in list[1:]:
    if element > maximum:
        maximum = element
```

Here, the invariant is:
> `maximum` contains the largest value **among those already traversed**.

## Why is it useful?
- To **reason** about how a program works.
- To **verify** that an algorithm is correct.
- To **demonstrate** a result in math or computer science (correctness proof).

::note
Invariants are often used in formal proofs, but even without going into proofs, they help better understand the behavior of an algorithm.

## Summary
| Term            | Meaning                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loop invariant  | A property that remains true at each loop turn                               |
| Before the loop | The invariant is already true before the first iteration                     |
| After each iteration | The invariant remains true, even if variables change                      |
| Usefulness      | Verify logic, fix a bug, or prove that the algorithm works                   |
