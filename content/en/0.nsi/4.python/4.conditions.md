## Introduction
Conditions are essential instructions in programming. They allow controlling the execution flow of a program based on certain conditions.

In Python, conditional structures allow performing tests and executing different parts of code based on the results of these tests.

## Comparison and logical operators
Conditions in Python use comparison operators and logical operators to evaluate expressions.

### Comparison operators
- `==` : equal to
- `!=` : not equal to
- `<` : less than
- `>` : greater than
- `<=` : less than or equal to
- `>=` : greater than or equal to

### Logical operators
- `and` : logical and
- `or` : logical or
- `not` : logical not

## Conditional structure `if`
The basic structure for conditions in Python is the `if` instruction.

```py
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

## Conditional structure `if...else`
The `else` instruction allows defining a block of code that executes when the `if` condition is false.

```py
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

## Conditional structure `if...elif...else`
The `elif` instruction (contraction of "else if") allows testing multiple conditions in sequence.

```py
x = 8
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

## Nested conditions
Conditions can be nested to verify multiple conditions.

```py
x = 7
y = 5
if x > 5:
    if y > 3:
        print("x is greater than 5 and y is greater than 3")
    else:
        print("x is greater than 5 but y is not greater than 3")
```

## Using complex conditions
The `and`, `or`, and `not` operators allow combining multiple conditions.

```py
x = 4
y = 6
if x > 2 and y < 10:
    print("x is greater than 2 AND y is less than 10")
if not(x > 5 or y > 10):
    print("x is NOT greater than 5 OR y is NOT greater than 10")
```

## Best practices

- **Clarity**: Avoid overly complex conditions. Use intermediate variables to clarify your code's intention.
- **Testing**: Always test your conditions with different sets of values to ensure they work correctly.
