title: Loops
description: The notion of loop is fundamental in computer science. A loop allows executing instructions multiple times, either while a condition is met (using the `while` loop), or by determining the number of __iterations__ that must be performed (using the `for` loop).
---

::callout
For loops, we also talk about __iterative structures__
::

## While loops
In English, __while__ means "as long as". We will therefore execute the instructions contained in the `while` block as long as a defined condition is verified.

Let's make a simple example: a countdown.

::code-group
```py [Countdown.py]
start_val = 3
while start_val >= 0:
  print(start_val)
  start_val -= 1
```

```bash [result.terminal]
3
2
1
0
```
::

The structure of a `while` block is very similar to that of an `if` block:

- the keyword is followed by a boolean
- we find the `:` character at the end of the line
- the block of instructions to execute is indented by one level

::callout
We talk about __conditional iteration__.
::

## For loops
In English, __for__ means "for". The typical use of a `for` loop will be for example for a sequence of numbers.  
Thus, we can for example perform instructions "for each item of the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]."  
Let's make a simple example: multiplication tables.

::code-group
```python [Multiplication table of 7.py]
number = 7
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:
  print(i*number)
```

```bash [result.terminal]
7
14
21
28
35
42
49
56
63
70
```
::

## Traversing a sequence
We briefly saw the `for`{lang='python'} keyword, particularly its use in combination with the `range()`{lang="py"} function. Thus, we were able to perform iterations on a defined number of elements.

The for instruction also allows traversing sequences: typically, tuples or lists! The structure is identical to using `range()`{lang="py"}, and here's an example:

::code-group
```python [Traversing a sequence]
# creating a list, this works the same way with a tuple
prime_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

for nb in prime_numbers:
  print(nb, "is a prime number.")
```

```bash [result]
1 is a prime number.
3 is a prime number.
5 is a prime number.
7 is a prime number.
11 is a prime number.
13 is a prime number.
17 is a prime number.
```
::

It is important to note that for a `for` loop, there is no longer a condition to be met for the loop to occur.

## The `range()` function
The `range()` function is a predefined function in Python. It allows generating sequences automatically. Thus, it is very practical for creating `for` loops.  
It can take one, two or three arguments depending on the sequence we want to create.

`range(start, end, step)`{lang="python" class="text-2xl"}

| Parameter | Type  | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`   | `int` | Indicates what value the sequence starts with. By default, it equals `0`.                              |
| `end`     | `int` | Corresponds to the excluding limit: if `end` equals `10`, the sequence will end at `9`.                |
| `step`    | `int` | Represents the increment: by default, `step` equals `1`, because the sequence advances by 1.               |

::code-group
  ```py [Examples of range() usage.py]
  # We define a printRange function
  # printRange displays on a single line a sequence generated by range()
  def printRange(range):
      for i in range:
          print(i, end=" ")
      print()

  printRange(range(10))
  printRange(range(3, 10))
  printRange(range(1, 10, 2))
  printRange(range(0, 100, 10))
  ```

```bash [result.terminal]
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
1 3 5 7 9 
0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90
