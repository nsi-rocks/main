title: 'Tutorial: CSV > Markdown (1)'
---

As a reminder, we saw in the tutorial how to approach manipulating a **multi-line string containing CSV format data**. The provided example corresponds to the code below:

```py
csvData = '''
activity, duration, importance
homework,4h,very important
Valorant,4h, important
Reading,4h, important
Gardening,2h,important
'''
```

The stated objective is to obtain, from the code above, the equivalent in the form of a Markdown table as could be generated by the site [Table Convert](https://tableconvert.com):

```
| activity  | duration | importance     |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| homework  | 4h       | very important |
| Valorant  | 4h       | important      |
| Reading   | 4h       | important      |
| Gardening | 2h       | important      |
```

## First part: `split()`
Our objective, to reconstruct the Markdown table, is to extract useful information such as `activity`, `duration`, `importance`, `Gardening`, `2h`, etc. without considering the **structural elements** of CSV, which are the comma `,` and the line break `\n`.

### First split: line breaks
The `csvData` string is a **multi-line** string which means it contains several line breaks. We will therefore start by separating these lines to be able to process them independently of each other.
The `split()` function allows this: `lines = csvData.split('\n')`

We then obtain, instead of a single multi-line variable, a list where each element corresponds to a line:

```py
# csvData is a single multi-line string
csvData = '''
activity, duration, importance
homework,4h,very important
Valorant,4h, important
Reading,4h, important
Gardening,2h,important
'''

lines = csvData.split('\n')

# To create the lines variable, we split csvData to get a list
# The list contains 7 elements, one for each line of csvData
# content of the lines variable:

[
    '',
    'activity, duration, importance',
    'homework,4h,very important',
    'Valorant,4h, important',
    'Reading,4h, important',
    'Gardening,2h,important',
    ''
]
```

### Second split: commas
To understand our objective, we will for now process only one line. For example, let's consider the string `'activity, duration, importance'`
This string contains three words separated by a comma then a space. We want to keep the words, and ignore the combination `, ` (comma then space).

The solution: use the `split()` function again, this time giving it "comma then space" as separator: `line.split(', ')`.
Thus, the string will be divided into three parts, and we will get the list `['activity', 'duration', 'importance']` which is a list of three items.

```py 
line = 'activity, duration, importance'
items = line.split(', ')

# We have therefore this time split a line and obtained a list
# This list, called here items, contains our words
# content of the items variable:

[
    'activity',
    'duration',
    'importance'
]
```

- We had a **single multi-line string**
- We split it at each line break, to get a **list of lines**
- We know how to split lines at each `comma then space`, to get a **list of words**

### Automate with `for`
By using the `for` keyword to create a loop, we were able to automate the process. In the previous part, we split **one single line**. But we have several, and depending on the example to choose we could have 5, 10, 100, etc.

By using the `for item in list:` instruction, we create a loop that will perform an iteration for each object in the list. For example:

```py
for item in ["cat", "dog", "bird"]:
    print(item)

# This simple code will have the effect of displaying:
cat
dog
bird

list = ["fish", "bee", "leopard"]
for word in list:
    print(word)

# This code will have the effect of displaying:
fish
bee
leopard
```

Based on this example, and taking into account what was explained in the two previous parts, we will be able, instead of splitting a single line, to split all lines one after the other. The following code is the complete final example seen in class on Tuesday:

::code-group
```py [example.py]
csvData = '''
activity, duration, importance
homework,4h,very important
Valorant,4h, important
Reading,4h, important
Gardening,2h,important
'''

lines = csvData.split('\n')

for line in lines:
    print(line.split(', '))
```

``` [result.terminal]
['']
['activity', 'duration', 'importance']
['homework,4h,very important']
['Valorant,4h', 'important']
['Reading,4h', 'important']
['Gardening,2h,important']
['']
```

We had also seen at the very end of the demonstration how to save values instead of simply displaying them, but each thing in its time: we already have enough things to review on this simple example.
