A new example of a constructed type is the **dictionary**.

On the same principle as the dictionaries we know, a dictionary is a set of **"key - value"** pairs: we no longer look for an element by its position in the sequence, but by the value of its identification key.

Similarly, in a dictionary, we look for the definition of a word by searching for that word: 
- the **key** is the word
- the **value** is its definition

## Dictionary manipulation
### Creating and reading a dictionary
We created tuples with parentheses, lists with brackets, for dictionaries we have curly braces:

```py
my_tuple = ("cat", 12, 13)
my_list = ["cat", 12, 13]
my_dictionary = {"car": "four-wheeled vehicle", "bike": "two-wheeled vehicle"}
```

To access an element of the dictionary, it's simple:
```py
>>> my_dictionary["car"]
four-wheeled vehicle
```

A dictionary can contain strings, integers, or any other type:

```py
number_of_wheels = { "car": 4, "bike": 2}
```

### Adding an element to a dictionary
To create a new entry in a dictionary, simply assign a value to the new key:

```py
my_dictionary["tricycle"] = "three-wheeled vehicle"
```

## Traversing a dictionary
We use the `items()` function.

Example with a `for` loop on one index:

```py
for item in my_dictionary.items():
    print(item)
```

Example with a `for` loop on two indices:

```py
for key, value in my_dictionary.items():
    print(key, value)
```
