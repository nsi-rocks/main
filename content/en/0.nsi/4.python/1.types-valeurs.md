title: Data Types
description: In Python, we manipulate data, in the form of static content, or in the form of variables. We will here review the four so-called **primitive** value types.
---
First, let's talk about assignment!

## Variable assignment
You can assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator.
Thus, the content of the expression **on the right** of the `=` operator will be assigned to the variable located **on the left**.

::code-group
```py [example.py]
variable = "castle"
print('I live in a', variable)
```

``` [result.terminal]
I live in a castle
```
::

A variable, in programming, is comparable to a box in which we can store a value. We can then look at the value inside (function `print`), modify the value or perform a test on it.

Below, three code examples that you can copy to observe the obtained result.

::code-group
```py [example1.py]
variable1 = 42
print(variable1)
variable1 = variable1 * 2
print(variable1)
```

```py [example2.py]
variable1 = 42
variable1 = "cat"
print(variable1)
```

```py [example3.py]
variable1 = "cat"
variable2 = variable1
print(variable2)
```
::

## Four native types

There are four so-called "native" value types.

You can access the type of a value using the `type(value)` function.

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `INT`      | An integer is a numeric value without decimal part.                                                                                                       | `-1`, `2`, `10`, `20`                      |
| `STR`      | A string is a sequence of characters. This can include letters, numbers, special characters, etc. It is always between single or double quotes. | `"the cat"`, `"812"`, `"@1234!xyz"`        |
| `FLOAT`    | A floating-point number is a numeric value with an integer part and a decimal part.                                                        | `123.4`, `-0.12`, `42.42`                  |
| `BOOL`     | A boolean can take two states: `True` or `False`, meaning respectively *true* or *false*.                                                             | `True`, `False`                            |

::callout
When assigning a value to a variable, you must always think about the type you are going to create.
<br />
For example, the expression `var = 42` will create an **integer** equal to 42. However, the expression `var = "42"` will create a **string** composed of the characters `4` and `2`.

## Type casting
While it's important to be aware of the type of values we manipulate, it's sometimes necessary to transform the type of a value according to the operations we may need to perform.

| Function      | Description                                                                                                      | Example                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `int()`       | Converts a value to integer. If the value is a string representing a number or a floating-point number, it is converted to integer. | `int('3')` returns `3` |
| `float()`     | Converts a value to floating-point number. This can be useful for converting integers or strings to decimal values. | `float('3.14')` returns `3.14` |
| `str()`       | Converts a value to string. Useful for transforming numbers, lists or other types to strings. | `str(123)` returns `'123'` |
