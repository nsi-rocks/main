- understand the difference between **expressions** and **instructions** in Python, as well as their role in a program
- importance of these two concepts for writing readable and efficient Python code
::

## Definitions and differences
### Expression
- An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators and functions that is evaluated to produce a value.
- An expression **always** returns a value

Simple examples: 

```py
2 + 3   # evaluates to 5
x * 10  # evaluates to the value of x multiplied by 10
"Hello" + " World" # evaluates to "Hello World"
```

More complex examples:

```py
(x + y) / 2
len("Python") > 5
```

### Instructions
- An instruction (or command) is a line of code that performs an action.
- Instructions do **not necessarily return a value**

Examples of instructions:
```py
x = 5       # Assignment instruction
print(x)    # Display instruction
if x > 0:   # Conditional instruction
    print("Positive")
```

## Expressions in detail
- Types of expressions:
    - Arithmetic expressions: `2 + 3, x - 1`
    - Boolean expressions: `x > 5`, `y == 0`
    - String expressions: `"Hello" + "World"`

- Expression evaluation:
    - Explain how Python evaluates expressions from left to right, respecting operator precedence rules.

- Using expressions in instructions:
    - An expression can be used inside an instruction:

```py
y = (x + 5) * 2  # Expression (x + 5) * 2 used in an assignment instruction
```

## Instructions
- Types of instructions:
    - Assignment instruction: `x = 10`
    - Control flow instruction: `if`, `for`, `while`
    - Function instruction: `def my_function():`
    - Import instruction: `import math`

- Compound and simple instructions:

    - Simple instructions: A single line of code, for example `x = 10.`
    - Compound instructions: Consist of multiple lines of code and include a code block (for example, loops and conditions).

- Using expressions in instructions:
    - Expressions are commonly used in conditional instructions or loops:

```py
if (x + 5) > 10:  # The expression (x + 5) > 10 is used to test the condition
    print("The condition is true.")
```
