## Creation

Creating a string in Python is done using single quotes (`'...'`), double quotes (`"..."`), or triple quotes (`'''...'''` or `"""..."""`) for multi-line strings.

::code-group

```python [example.py]
variable1 = 42 # creating an integer
print("Variable type:", type(variable1))

variable1 = "42" # creating a string
print("Variable type:", type(variable1))
```

```bash [result.terminal]
Variable type: <class 'int'>
Variable type: <class 'str'>
```

## Concatenation

It is possible to stick strings together using the `+` operator, this is called **concatenation**.

```py [concatenation.py]
animal = "cat"
name = "Felix"

sentence = "My animal is a "+animal+", and its name is "+name
```

::callout
We then get a string `sentence` which is equal to:
"My animal is a cat, and its name is Felix"
::

## String methods

| Method           | Description                                                                                                  | Example                                                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `join()`         | Concatenates a sequence of elements into a single string, inserting a string between each element. | `'/'.join(['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday'])` returns `'monday/tuesday/wednesday'`      |
| `split()`        | Splits a string into a list of substrings. The default separator is space.          | `'monday tuesday wednesday'.split()` returns `['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday']`       |
| `upper()`        | Transforms the string to uppercase.                                                           | `'inFoRmatics'.upper()` returns `'INFORMATICS'`                                        |
| `lower()`        | Transforms the string to lowercase.                                                           | `'iNfOrMatics'.lower()` returns `'informatics'`                                        |
| `capitalize()`   | Transforms the **first** character to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.                                  | `'iNfOrMaticS'.capitalize()` returns `'Informatics'`                                   |
| `replace()`      | Replaces a sequence of characters in a string with another.                                             | `'Cats are independent.'.replace('Cats', 'Dogs')` returns `'Dogs are independent.'` |

## Formatting

### `.format()` Method

We call the `format()` method on a string. In this string, we identify the locations where we want to insert values using substitution markers `{}`.
We then indicate as parameters of the `format()` method the values we want to insert in place of the markers. Let's take the previous example with this principle:

```py
animal = "cat"
name = "Felix"

sentence = "My animal is a {}, and its name is {}".format(animal, name)
```

::callout
We then get a string `sentence` which is equal to:
"My animal is a cat, and its name is Felix"
::

Substitution markers can be completed with a key or index to facilitate formatting and organization of arguments:

```py
animal = "cat"
name = "Felix"

sentence = "My animal is a {var1}, and its name is {firstname}".format(var1=animal, firstname=name)
sentence = "My animal is a {1}, and its name is {0}".format(name, animal)
```

::callout
The result will be identical to the previous examples here. The value of the keys used is arbitrary, it's simply an organizational aid.
::

### f-strings

Since [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/whatsnew/3.6.html), we can format strings more easily using f-strings. Remember to add the letter `f` before the quotes.

**f-strings** are more performant than the `.format()` method, they are also more readable, making them a recommended practice for Python 3.6 and higher versions.

```py [f-strings example]
animal = "cat"
name = "Felix"

sentence = f"My animal is a {animal}, and its name is {name}"
```

The `.format()` method like f-strings allow more advanced formatting, we will talk about it later.
