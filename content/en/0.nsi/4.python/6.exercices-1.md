To practice conditions, loops, and string manipulation, here are some practical exercises to do:

## Exercise 1: Counting Characters in a String (Easy)
::badge{label="easy"}
::
**Objective:** Work on string manipulation and loops.

- Write a program that asks the user to enter a string.
- The program must display the number of characters present in the string, excluding spaces.

**Instructions:**
- Use a `for` loop to traverse the string.
- Use an `if` condition to ignore spaces.

**Example:**

- Input: "Hello world"
- Output: "Number of characters (without spaces): 10"

## Exercise 2: Determine Number Parity
::badge{label="medium"}
::
**Objective:** Use loops and conditions.

- Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer.
- Then, the program must display all numbers from 0 to this number with an indication if they are even or odd.

**Instructions:**
- Use a `for` loop to traverse the range of numbers.
- Use an `if...else` condition to determine the parity of each number.

**Example:**

- Input: 5
- Output: "0 is even" "1 is odd" "2 is even" "3 is odd" "4 is even" "5 is odd"

## Exercise 3: Strong Password
::badge{label="medium"}
::
**Objective:** Work on conditions and string manipulation.

- Write a program that asks the user to enter a password.
- The program must check if the password is **strong** according to the following criteria:
  - At least 8 characters.
  - Contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit and one special character (for example, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.).
- Display a message indicating if the password is strong or weak.

**Instructions:**
- Use string methods like `isupper()`, `islower()`, `isdigit()`.
- Use `if...elif...else` conditions to check the criteria.

**Example:**

- Input: "Passw0rd!"
- Output: "Strong password"

## Exercise 4: Calculate the GCD of Two Numbers
::badge{label="difficult"}
::
**Objective:** Use loops and conditions to implement a classic algorithm.

- Write a program that asks the user to enter two positive integers.
- Calculate the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of these two numbers using Euclid's algorithm.
- Display the result.

**Instructions:**
- Use a `while` loop to implement Euclid's algorithm:
  - While the two numbers are not equal, replace the larger of the two with the difference between the two.
- Use conditions to compare the numbers.

**Example:**

- Input: 48, 18
- Output: "The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6"

## Exercise 5: Analyze Word Frequency in a Sentence
::badge{label="difficult"}
::
**Objective:** Advanced string manipulation, loops and conditions.

- Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence.
- The program must count and display the frequency of each word in the sentence.
- Ignore case (uppercase/lowercase) and punctuation marks.

**Instructions:**
- Use `split()` to divide the sentence into words.
- Use a dictionary to store the frequency of each word.
- Use loops and conditions to clean words of all punctuation and count their occurrence.

**Example:**

- Input: "Hello, hello the world! The world is vast."
- Output: "hello: 2" "the: 2" "world: 2" "is: 1" "vast: 1"
